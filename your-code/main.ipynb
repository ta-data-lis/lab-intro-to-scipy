We'll start by creating two derived columns in our dataframe. The first will contain 1 if the amount of money in `usd_pledged_real` is greater than the amount of money in `usd_goal_real`. We can compute this by using the `np.where` function. If the amount in one column is greater than the other, enter a value of 1, otherwise enter a value of zero.

You can read more about the `fisher_exact` function [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.fisher_exact.html#scipy.stats.fisher_exact). The output of the function should be the odds ratio and the p-value. The p-value will provide you with the outcome of the test."
